## Overview
Welcome to your personal Weather Dashboard that will give you weather for your desired location. Once you search for a city, it will save your previous searches as easy to click buttons. Use these buttons to view the weather for the selected city. You will always be presented with the last city you typed in the search box when you revisit the page.

## Usage

**Search for a city by typing in the name and clicking search:**

   ![city search](./assets/imgs/city-search.jpg)

#### Use a previous search by clicking on a button to display the weather for that location:
   ![previous city search](./assets/imgs/view-previous-search.jpg)

#### The UV Index will show the appropriate color based on the following scale:
